# APIs-AJAX-Homework

## What this page does:
In this assignment, I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of the user's choice.
- When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

- When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

- Under every gif, its rating is displayed (PG, G, so on).

- Bonus: Buttons, input form, and GIFs should each be in their own row on small screens (mobile)

- Bonus: added a 1-click download except I'm pretty sure GIPHY is blocking the download? it's redirecting.
